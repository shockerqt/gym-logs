### 1. **Workout Day** (DÃ­a de entrenamiento)

- This is the entire session you plan to do in a single day (e.g., "Chest and Triceps Day").

### 2. **Exercise** (Ejercicio)

- A specific movement or activity targeting a muscle group (e.g., "Bench Press" or "Squats").

### 3. **Set** (Serie)

- A group of repetitions performed consecutively without rest. For example, 3 sets of 10 repetitions.

### 4. **Repetition (Rep)** (RepeticiÃ³n)

- A single complete movement of an exercise. For example, one push-up is one repetition.

### 5. **Rest Period** (Tiempo de descanso)

- The time you take to rest between sets (e.g., 60 seconds).

### 6. **Tempo** (Tempo)

- The speed at which you perform each repetition, often broken into phases (e.g., 2-1-2: 2 seconds lowering, 1 second pause, 2 seconds lifting).

### 7. **Intensity** (Intensidad)

- The weight or difficulty level of the exercise, often expressed as a percentage of your one-rep max (1RM) or as RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion).

### 8. **Volume** (Volumen)

- The total amount of work done, calculated as: **Sets Ã— Reps Ã— Weight**.

### 9. **Progressive Overload** (Sobrecarga progresiva)

- Gradually increasing the weight, reps, or sets over time to continue making progress.
